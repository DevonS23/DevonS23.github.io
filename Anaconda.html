<p>A conda hognose snake is a snake with the anaconda gene from one parent, it reduces the pattern to larger and fewer spots. You can see a hognose anaconda snake above. </p>

<p>A superconda hognose snake is a snake with the anaconda gene from both parents, the pattern is not only reduced but non-existent. They are garenteed to pass on one anaconda gene to all of their babies. So, unless the babies have another conda gene from the other parent, they will all be anaconda, not superconda, hognose snakes.</p>
