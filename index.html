<p>Morphs:</p>
<p>A morph is a <strong>color or pattern mutation</strong> caused by a mutation in a snake's genes, which can be passed on from parents. There are different types of morphs. The hognose snakes I will be showing you are western hognoses, but there are also eastern and southern hognose snakes. Also any type of snake can have morphs. </p>
