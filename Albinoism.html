<p>Albino Morph: </p>
<p>Albinoism removes dark pigmentaion/melonin from a snake's scales. It turns the eyes red, and can occur in many animals, including humans! The eyes are red due to lack of melonin and are quite sensitive to UV rays/sunlight. The picture above is a western hognose snake with the albino morph. Abinoism is basically the oposite of an axanthic snake. </p>
